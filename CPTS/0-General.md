## VM
- [ ] Improve the ability to start attacking VMs
	- [ ] Should be able to pick a distro 
	- [ ] Dynamically load needed tools
- [ ] Improve the ability to spin up separated victim OS's for testing vulnerabilities, in a separated VLAN, with an attacker VM in it 
	- [ ] Want the option to turn on network monitoring with a SIEM, andfirewalls 
- [ ] Want Firewalls and SIEMs in base env as well
- [ ] Perhaps the ability to VPN into it as well would be good
